### Contributing to Sandbox-2D
Thanks for taking the time to contribute! These are guidelines on how to contribute better, not strict rules. Feel free to propose changes to this document.

### ToC
- [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs)
- [Suggesting Enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements)
- [Contributing Code](#contributing-code)
- [Pull Requests](#pull-requests)
- [Code Style](#code-style)

### Reporting Bugs
Before creating a new issue, please check if there isn't already a similar one. Issues can be created [here](https://github.com/Acerx-AMJ/Sandbox-2D/issues).

An issue should contain the following:
- Your operating system
- Way of installation (github, itch, etc.)
- What's wrong
- Expected result
- How to reproduce the issue and can it reliably be reproduced

The issue title should be short and descriptive, for example the title for an issue of a crash when opening the inventory might be "Opening inventory causes crash.". You should describe the exact steps you took to reproduce the problem.

### Suggesting Enhancements
Just like bug reports, enhancements are tracked in [Issues](https://github.com/Acerx-AMJ/Sandbox-2D/issues). Before creating a new issue, please check if the functionality isn't already present.

Enhancements should have a descriptive title and description. You should describe current behaviour and explain what behaviour you were expecting and why this may be useful. If you know other projects that have implemented it, make sure to list them.

### Contributing Code
To get started fork the repository, clone the fork locally, and make sure that the project builds and runs on your machine. There is a guide for building in [README.md](README.md).

When you feel comfortable with the project, please read the [PR guidelines](#pull-requests) and [code style guidelines](#code-style) and create a pull request.

### Pull Requests
When creating a PR, please add a descriptive title and list all changes made in description. If needed, add screenshots or GIFs. Commit small changes, but frequently, ideally a single commit should not exceed 150 changed lines unless necessary.

Commit messages and PRs must be gramatically correct. In commit messages explain what was changed and where.

Do not create PRs of incomplete features or broken builds. Make sure to test your code before sending it.

### Code Style
When writing or modifying existing code try to follow the style of the surrounding code. As long as the code is readable, it most likely will be fine.
